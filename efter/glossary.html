			<h3 id="glossary">Glossary and expressions</h3>
			<div class="subsection">
				Some of these descriptions are taken from "Studentlivsparlören", which is handed out by AF to exchange students. <a href="img/studentlife.pdf">You can read it in its entirety here.</a>
				<ul>
					<li><p><b>Akademisk kvart</b> - back in the day before cell phones were popular, in order to keep track on time students at Lund University would listen to the bell chimes of Lund's old cathedral. Every time they rung, you knew it was a full hour and probably time to head to your lecture, which resulted in everyone being a bit late. This tradition still lives on, thus in Lund we have something called "akademisk kvart", or academy quarter in English. So when it says that your lecture is supposed to start att 8, it really means 8:15.</p>
					Exams and some other events don't follow this rule, though. They may let you know this by typing 8 (.) or "8 prick", which means "8 sharp" in English.</li>
					<li><b>Dress codes</b> - there will often be a dress code specified in an event invitation. This is supposed to help you know what to wear and how formal the event is. Keep in mind that a dress code is not there to make you unhappy or broke, having to go out shopping for expensive clothes that you will only wear once. Why not ask a friend if you may borrow their formal attire? You can also talk to the event organiser if you are uncertain if a particular piece of clothing fits the occasion.
						<ol>
							<li><i>Mörk kostym (dark business suit)</i> - Dark business suit (black, grey, brown or dark blue) or a nicer dress or skirt with a top.</li>
							<li><i>Högtidsdräkt (formal)</i> - Evening grown (nicer long dress that is floor-length) or a tail-coat, however a dark business suit will most often be enough. Ask if you are uncertain.</li>
							<li><i>Bruten kavaj (broken suit)</i> - Dressed up everyday attire. A suit jacket or something you feel pretty in.</li>
							<li><i>Temaenligt (according to theme)</i> - some sittnings have themes that you have to dress accordingly to. This is very rarely a strict dress code; follow the theme as well as you can! </li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><b>Efterfest (after party)</b> - the eftersläpp might close at 03.00 AM, but why stop there? There will quite often be someone who hosts an party after closing - a so called after party.</li>
					<li><b>Eftersläpp</b> - the part of an evening that resembles a club night. It usually comes after the sittning is done, and you can usually attend the eftersläpp even if you did not attend the main event.</li>
					<li><b>Förfest (pre party)</b> - in Sweden we call it pre partying instead pre drinks. It's virtually the same thing, though.</li>
					<li><b>Gyckel</b> - this is the entertainment during a sittning. Someone (most often a small group of people) goes on stage and perform some kind of act. Usually it's a parody of a song with rewritten and funny lyrics, but a gyckel can consist of basically anything with entertainment value. </li>
					<li><b>Mellanfest (middle party)</b> - the eftersläpp is often held in the same location as the sittning took place. This means that the people who worked at the sittning need to clean out the room in order to let people back in. In the meantime you probably need something to do, so why not throw a mellanfest?</li>
					<li><b>Singing traditions</b> - the tradition of singing while dining is very deeply rooted in the Nordic countries. Since universities are particularly strong bearers of tradition, there is also a long tradition of singing at student related events. You shouldn't be surprised to find a pamphlet with song lyrics at a sittning in Lund. You also shouldn't be worried if you know neither the lyrics nor the melody of the song. All newcomers start with zero knowledge and learn little by little, and the "more experienced" students won't judge you for it.</li>
					<li><b>Sittning</b> - a sittning is (most often) a three coursed dinner. These dinners often includes speeches and a lot of singing of student songs as well as more general ones. Don't be surprised if the sittning includes some wacky dresscode. </li>
					<li><b>Spex</b> - spex is a kind of amateur comedy theatre, a farce, with a musical like mix of acting and singing. Spex usually come with a lot of satire and parody. By applauding a scene, the audience can make the actors act of the scene or punchline a new way.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3 id="lth">Specific for LTH</h3>
			<div class="subsection">
				<ul>
					<li><b>sjön Sjön (lake Lake)</b> - this is a lake that is called Lake, and since it is located in the heart of the LTH campus it is subject to many activities during the nollning. The lake Lake has existed from the founding of LTH, and the different traditions surrounding it are often just as old.</li>
					<li><b>ön Ön (island Island)</b> - in sjön Sjön there's an island. This island is naturally called Island.</li>
					<li><b>Colored overalls (student boilersuits)</b> - every guild on LTH has its own color. The overalls are colored according to the guild you are in. This way it is easy to identify what another student studies, and it gives the students an opportunity to represent their own guild. The D-guild (computer science) has pink as its color! Ask your phadder if you are curious about what the other colors represent - they'll know. </li>
					<li><b>Gasque</b> - this word most often refers to Gasque-salen; the banquet hall which can be found in the basement of Kårhuset. Here you will take part in several sittnings and eftersläpp.</li>
					<li><b>The different guilds</b> - there are eleven guilds on LTH which represents the different programmes. They all have their on board and budgets, and they act as a meeting place and second home for the students. You can read more about the guilds and what programmes they represtent on <a href="http://www.lth.se/utbildning/studera/studentliv/sektionerna/">LTH's site</a>; the website is in swedish but Google translate does the trick.</li>
