			INFORMATION
		</div>
		<div id="info" class="info-section">
			<h3 id="guilds">Kåren and the guilds</h3>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p>Every student at LTH is a member of Teknologkåren, TLTH. Teknologkåren represents the voices of the students against the university, and acts as a meeting place for the students. The main task for Teknologkåren is to supervise the different educations, but they also work with a lot of other things. For example, they improve the work environment for the students, take care of things regarding student aid, they mainain a close relationship with the business (näringslivet), entertainment, parties, and leisure activities. </p>

				<p>The expedition for Teknologkåren can be found in Kårhuset. You can also find the full time workers of Teknologkåren here. These are students who pauses their studies for one year in order to wholeheartedly work for Teknologkåren.</p>

				<p>Teknologkåren elects a Nollegeneral every year, this is a person who coordinates the different guilds' nollningar. Some of the activities during the nollning are performed by all the guilds together, as for example Regattan and Nollelördagen. You can read more about this on <a href="https://nollning.tlth.se/"> the nollning information</a> on Teknologkårens website. This is not always available in English, though.</p>

				<p>Teknologkåren is divided into eleven different guilds. A guild includes students from one or more program at LTH. The guilds take care of questions that directly concerns the students at their respective programs. Your guild is is called the Computer Science Guild, often called D-guild. The letter D comes from the Swedish word for computer science; datateknik. You can read more about the what the D-guild works with on their website <a href="https://www.dsek.se/">www.dsek.se</a> (this website is in Swedish only, but Google translate does a pretty good job at translating it). </p>

			<h3 id="lund">About Lund and Sweden</h3>
			<div class="subsection">
				<li><b>Healthcare</b> - healthcare in Sweden is (almost) free. You pay at maximum 300SEK for a visit at the doctor. However, the way these visits work in Sweden can be different from other countries. Drop in-times are prioritized, meaning if you walk in with a not so super serious issue, expect other patients to be prioritized over you and you might be waiting for over two hours. What you are supposed to do instead is to call and book an appointment in beforehand, <a href="https://www.kth.se/blogs/tianlin/2017/02/how-to-book-an-appointment-with-doctor-in-sweden/">this blog from KTH explains in detail how to book a doctor's appointment.</a>  </li>
				<li><b>Sirens every three month</b> - on the first Monday every three months (Mars, June, September and December) at 3 sharp in the afternoon, Sweden tests its air raid warnings. These are sirens that are evenly distributed on (mostly) tall buildings throughout Sweden. The system has been tested this way since 1931, meaning all Swedes are accustomed to it. The sound of the sirens can however come as a shock if you are not prepared for it. So if you hear the sirens (they are very hard not to hear), do not be afraid. It is just a routine test. </li>
				<li><b>Payments</b> - in Sweden we barely use cash anymore; we are moving towards a so called cash-free society. This means that you will very rarely be able to pay by cash during the nollning, however most regular stores still accept it. It could be wise to check if you have a high fee on card transactions while abroad, since this could be a problem for you during your first weeks here.</li>
				<li><b>The difference between guilds and nations</b> - what guilds are to LTH, nations are to all students at Lund's University. In order to become a member of (and to get involved in) a guild you need to be a student at LTH and a member of Teknologkåren. The corresponding requirements for nations are that you have to be a student at Lund's University, and a member of Studentlund. You become a member of Studentlund when you gain membership at a nation (which is free). You can read more about the different nations, what they do, and how to get involved at <a href="https://www.studentlund.se/" target="_blank">studentlund.se</a>.</li>

			<h3 id="help">Are you feeling bad?</h3>
			<div class="subsection-2">
				<p>If you ever are feeling bad, or feel that you are being treated badly during your time here at LTH and during the nollning, ther are a couple of places and persons you can turn to.</p>
				<li>Staben or pepparna, especially if there's anything that can be directly related to the nollning.</li>
				<li>Your phadder, who can help you find the right person to talk to.</li>
				<li>Studenthälsan (the student health counselling). They take care of students who need help <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/current-students/health-care/student-health-counselling">You can find more information on their website.</a></li>
